# IceStream
IceStream is a real-time data observability system that monitors streaming data, detects data-quality problems, isolates bad records, and provides visibility into the health of the data pipeline.

# 📅 Day 1 — Project Setup

## Objective

Started the development of **IceStream – Real-Time Lakehouse Observability**.

The main objective of the project is to build a real-time system that monitors streaming data, detects data-quality problems, isolates bad records, and provides visibility into the health of the data pipeline.

## Work Completed

- Created the IceStream project repository.
- Created the basic project folder structure.
- Defined the overall project architecture.
- Identified the main technologies required for the project.
- Created the initial README documentation.

# 📅 Day 2 — Initial IceStream Components

## Objective

Started implementing the main components of the IceStream real-time data pipeline by creating the transaction generator, Kafka producer, Flink validation logic, Iceberg schemas, and initial Streamlit dashboard.

## Work Completed

- Created a Python transaction generator for continuous mock e-commerce data.
- Created the Kafka producer for sending transaction data to the `transactions` Kafka topic.
- Created Flink processing logic for validating incoming transactions.
- Added data-quality checks for required transaction fields and invalid amounts.
- Created Iceberg schemas for good data and bad data/DLQ records.
- Created the initial Streamlit dashboard for displaying IceStream monitoring information.
- Defined the basic pipeline flow from transaction generation to the dashboard.
